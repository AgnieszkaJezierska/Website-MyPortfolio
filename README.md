# one-page-website-portfolio

---------------------------
## Description
It is my first project where I am learning how to use CSS and HTML. No biggy but first baby steps are very important to achieve something really big and that's what I'm trying to do. This website will be like a buisness card, so I will probably work on it all the time. Never ending-story which is very motivating when it grows.

## Built with
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript ES6+

## Still to-do
all html with right text, all CSS(with RWD),  CV detail display (pop-out window - display button is stick to right side of website and following with scrolling) and download PDF CV button on CV pop-out website, light/dark option, menu(name/logo, navigation, CV, blog, contact), menu on bottom(start screen) with scrolling sticking on top, ang/pl option, contact form, RWD, start screen leftside is hiding with scrolling, portfolio gallery with good visual effect, contact form, project or so on counters
